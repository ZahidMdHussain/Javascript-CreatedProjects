              Frequently asked questions, or FAQs as they are known, are a great
              way to improve your customer's experience of your website. It
              allows you to answer the questions that are most commonly asked
              surrounding your product or service.

            <div class="question">What questions should be on a FAQ page?</div>
            <div class="answer">
              Your FAQ page should address the most common questions customers
              have about your products, services, and brand as a whole. The best
              way to identify those questions is to tap into your customer
              service data and see which problems customers are consistently
              reaching out to you with.

            <div class="question">Are FAQs good?</div>
            <div class="answer">
              FAQs are a good indicator that there may be an issue with your
              content. Most are created because people think by bringing
              frequently asked questions together on a single page, they will
              make it easier for people to find the answers they are looking
              for.
